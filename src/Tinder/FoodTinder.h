// Food Tinder:
//     swipe right for good dish, left for bad dish; desirable traits are found and similar dishes are offered - namely flavour profile, cost, and complexity
//     dishes can be favourited/super-liked to double how impactful their traits are on the algorithm
//     one can stop at any time and cook the given recipe by clicking some buttor, OR, regenerate the list of dishes with similar ones that had been swiped left previously
