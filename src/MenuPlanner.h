// Menu Planner:
//     select number of courses (3 to 17), cuisine(s) (if any), and other delimiters -  specifically "dominant" dishes, such as main courses, determining the meal (ie, red meat with 
//     red wine and a richer dessert) -> this leads into the usual (and main) functional recipe selector, but acts in a somewhat cumulative way, the calculation for which 
//     is similar to individual dishes
//     Also provided are wine pairings, cheese pairings, and the like (with a little emoji of both offering you a recommendation to it)
//         - One can cycle through these pairings if they are undesirable, but they are finite (and in future, all wines and cheeses can be added as ingredients and somehow paired that way)
